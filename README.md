Iris – The Chatbot

Iris is a simple rule-based chatbot made using Python.
The project started as a terminal chatbot and was later extended with a graphical user interface using Tkinter.
This project was built to understand how basic chatbot logic works and how Python logic can be connected to a GUI.

What this project does : 
1) Greets the user and asks for their name.
2) Remembers the user’s name during the conversation
3) Responds based on simple mood-based rules
4) Runs inside a desktop window using Tkinter
5) Closes the application when the user types “bye”

Technologies used : 
- Python Fundamentals
- Tkinter

How it works : 
a) Iris starts the conversation and asks for the user’s name
b) The chatbot stores the name and continues chatting
c) Responses are generated using predefined rules
d) The Enter key or Send button sends messages
e) Typing “bye” ends the conversation and closes the app

Project structure : 
iris.py – terminal version of the chatbot &
iris_gui.py – GUI version of the chatbot along with README.md

Learning outcome : 
1) Built a complete Python project from scratch
2) Learned how to use Tkinter for GUI applications
3) Understood how chatbot logic connects with user interfaces
4) Improved confidence in writing and structuring Python programs

Future improvements : 
1) Better conversation handling
2) Improved GUI design
3) Smarter responses
